============
Introduction
============

PyASM is a full-featured dynamic assembler written entirely in Python.  By dynamic, I mean that it can be used to generate and execute machine code in python at runtime without requiring the generation of object files and linkage.  It essentially allow 'inline' assembly in python modules on x86 platforms.

PyASM can also generate object files (for windows) like a traditional standalone assembler, although you're probably better off using one of the many freely available assemblers if this is you primary goal.

------------
Installation
------------

PyASM requires python 2.4 or later.  To the best of my knowledge, the only 2.4 specific feature I've used is `from x import (a,b,c)`, but I need to draw a line in the sand somewhere as far as the installations I'll test and support.

Linux Install:

    + Download and extract pyasm-0.2.tar.gz_
    + python setup.py install

Windows Install:

    + Download and run pyasm-0.2.win32-py2.4.exe_
    + A source distribution pyasm-0.2.zip_ is available, but you'll need VS7.0 to 
      compile the excmem module.

Hello World!
------------

A simple Windows version of a hello_world.py program is as follows::

  #
  # Hello World in assembly:  pyasm/examples/hello_World.py
  #
  #

  from pyasm import pyasm

  pyasm(globals(),r"""
     !CHARS hello_str 'Hello world!\n\0'

     !PROC hello_world PYTHON
     !ARG  self
     !ARG  args

          PUSH hello_str
          CALL PySys_WriteStdout
          ADD ESP, 0x4
          MOV EAX,PyNone
          ADD [EAX],1
     !ENDPROC
     """)

  hello_world()

A brief description of what is happening durring the pyasm call:

  1. the globals() statement tells pyasm where to bind newly created python 
     functions
  2. The !CHARS directive creates a string constant.
  3. The !PROC and !ARG directives create a procedure that matches the 
     standard CPythonFunction signature [PyObject* hello_world(PyObject* self,
     PyObject* args) and create procedure initialization code.
  4. The procedure calls python's PySys_WriteStdout function.  Since python functions
     use CDECL calling conventions, we:
      
        a) PUSH the paramters onto the stack from right to left
        b) CALL the function
        c) Cleanup the stack ourselves

  5. PyCFunctions must return some sort of python object, so we:

        a) Load PyNone into the EAX register, which will become the return value.
        b) Add one to the reference count

  6. The !ENDPROC directive ends the procedure and creates function cleanup code.
This creates a procedure called hello_world that would have the C signature of `PyObject* hello_world(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)`.  The procedure loads hello_str onto the stack, calls the python interpreters PySys_WriteStdout function, 

  7. Calling hello_world() executes the newly created function.

----------------
Assembler Syntax
----------------

Like most assemblers, the command-line assembler contains a very simple parser.  There two basic statements that can be used.  An *instruction statement* and an *assembler directive*.  *Assembler directives* contain information that makes your assembly a little easier to read than raw assembly code, such as the begining and ending of function; declaration of parameters, variables, constants and data; and other stuff.  *Instruction Statements* consist of real assembly instructions such as `MOV [EAX+4],value`

Additional notes specific to this assembler are as follows:

  + Numbers use python's formatting scheme, so hex is represented as 0xFF and not FFh.

Instruction Statements
----------------------

Instruction statements are reasonably straightforward if you know x86 assembly language.  Instruction mneumonics and register names are in all capitals.

Assembler Directives
--------------------

Assembler directives begin with an exclamation mark, followed by the directive itself, and followed by any applicable parameters.  Keep in mind that these directives are provided for the programmer's convienence.  Anything that is done via a directive could be translated into raw assembly, it's just not as readable.

|                       |                | loops, if-then logic, etc.  You can use|
|                       |                | a label and hand-roll a procedure,     |
|                       |                | but you probably want to use the !PROC |
|                       |                | directive instead.                     |

Typical Usage
-------------

Typically, usage is as simple as the hello world example listed above.  Import the pyasm function from the pyasm package and call it.  globals blah blah blah.

--------------------
Assembly via the API
--------------------

calling pyasm is fine if you're just trying to inline some assembly functions, but if you're trying to dynamically generate assembly (such as writing a python compiler) you're better off accessing the api directly.  This involves a few steps:

  1) import the assembler class from x86 asm and instantiate.
  2) Add instructions either as strings that need to be preprocessed or via the api.
  3) generate an intermediate 'codepackage' by calling the .Compile() method
  4) transform the codePackage to runtime memory via CpToMemory.

----------------------
Command-line assembler
----------------------

**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**

If you really want to, a command-line asembler is available for usage.  Usage is straightforward::

    python pyassemble.py asmfile.asm

This will generate an object file asmfile.o that can be used by your linker.
