PyASM by Grant Olson <olsongt at verizon.net>
=============================================

PyASM is a dynamic x86 assembler for python.  By "dynamic", I mean that it can be used to generate inline assembly functions in python at runtime without requiring object file generation or linkage.

New in version 0.3
------------------

  + Implicit string variable creation is now possible.  i.e. "PUSH 'foo\n\0'" now works instead of requiring "!CHARS foo 'foo\n\0'" and "PUSH foo"
  + New !CALL assembler directive handles throwing arguements onto the stack.
  + Fixed tokenizer for instruction definitions with numbers in them such as INT 3
  + Now includes an 'examples' directory that should be easier for users to read than the test directory.

New in version 0.2
------------------

 + Linux Support.  Will work in Linux environments as well as Windows.
 + Simplified Interface.  You only need to use one function to generate code.
 + Preliminary Documentation.
