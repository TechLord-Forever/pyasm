PyASM by Grant Olson <olsongt at verizon.net>
=============================================

PyASM is a dynamic x86 assembler for python.  By "dynamic", I mean that it can be used to generate inline assembly functions in python at runtime without requiring object file generation or linkage.

New in version 0.2
------------------

 + Linux Support.  Will work in Linux environments as well as Windows.
 + Simplified Interface.  You only need to use one function to generate code.
 + Preliminary Documentation.
