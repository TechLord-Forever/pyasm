PyASM by Grant Olson <olsongt at verizon.net>
=============================================

PyASM is a dynamic x86 assembler for python.  By "dynamic", I mean that it can
be used to generate inline assembly functions in python at runtime without
requiring object file generation or linkage.

New in version 0.3
------------------

  + Implicit string variable creation is now possible.  e.g. "PUSH 'foo\n\0'"
  now works instead of requiring "!CHARS foo 'foo\n\0'" and "PUSH foo"
  
  + New !CALL assembler directive handles throwing arguements onto the stack.
  e.g.  "!CALL foo bar baz bot" instead of "PUSH bot" "PUSH baz" "PUSH bar"
  "CALL foo"
  
  + Fixed tokenizer for instruction definitions with numbers in them such as
  INT 3
  
  + Now includes an 'examples' directory that should be easier for users to
  read than the test directory.

  + Show symbol name in disassembly if it exists.

New in version 0.2
------------------

 + Linux Support.  Will work in Linux environments as well as Windows.
 + Simplified Interface.  You only need to use one function to generate code.
 + Preliminary Documentation.
